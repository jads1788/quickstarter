## Quickstarter Campaigns Overview
The data comprehends 4114 cases distributed throughout 13 countries.
* The Goal column tells us how much money each campaign will need to succeed.
* The Pledged column tells us how much each campaign actually made.
* The Outcomes column tells us if the campaign met its goal.
Added a color-scheme to help identify campaigns based on the outcomes:
Successful = Green
Live = Blue
Canceled = Yellow
Failed = Red
* The Country column lists the country in which the campaign was started.
* The Percentage Funded indicates by how much a campaign succeeded or failed.
The color-scheme indicates goes from red to blue (90 percentile) to shows if a campaign was funded or not, and by how much.
* The Average Donation establishes the typical or normal amount donated historically.

## Subcategories Outcomes
[INSERT THEATER CATEGORY OUTCOMES HERE]
A more relevant analysis for the customer requires an inspection within the Theater campaigns, divided into 3 subcategories: Musical, Plays and Spaces. The chart above shows that the Play subcategory has the highest number of a)campaigns, and b)successful outcomes.

## Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns between <$1000 and up to $20,000 have a 50% of success rate; and it picks up at 50% again between $35,000 and $50,000.
The number of failed campaigns began raising exponentially as the campaign goals grew, peaking at $35,000, where close to 80% of campaigns failed. After a substancial drop in failure of about 50 points on campaigns asking between $35,000 and $40,000, failed campaigns reached their peak at almost 100% for campaigns asking from $50,000 or more.

We would also like to point out that no campaign was cancelled, regardless of their goals.

## Outcomes Based on Campaign Lenght
A majority of campaigns tend to have a duration of approximately 4 weeks. Although there are more successful campaings in the 30 days range, the ratio of failed campaigns also raises exponentially. 
When we specify our analysis into the Theater/Play subcategories within the US, we noticed that the success rates are higher for campaigns that last between 1 and 4 weeks, where 4 weeks seems to be the final recommendation for the customer.

[INSERT OUTCOMES BASED ON LAUNCH HERE]
Analysis have shown that successful campaigns tend to be launched in May, and that success maintains throught July. On the other end, campaigns launched on December tend to fail.

## US Quickstarter Campaigns: Theater/Plays
### Descriptive Statistics Analysis
Based on our analysis we found that:
1) Failed Quickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Quickstarter campaigns. 
Taking into consideration that the customer is estimating to ask for more than twice the average successful Quickstarter goal, we recommend reconsidering the campaign funds goal.
2) In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Quickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money.

## Great Britain Quickstarter Market
### Comparing US & GB
Snapshot: US has a total of 3038 campaigns, while GB 604 campaigns.
When comparing successful campaigns in the US and GB markets, we noticed the GB one is dominated almost exclusively by Theater projects, specifically by the Play subcategory; meanwhile in the US, the successful market is shared with at least 3 other categories (i.e. music, film & video, and technology, respectively).

### Foresight play
This is an example of a successful campaign with just under a 4-week duration, the donations averaged £117 (US$144), with a total of 17 backers.

### Musical Campaign on GB
[Insert MusicalGBBoxPlot.png]
1) The mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. 
2) Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
3) 25% of musical campaigns got no funding at all.
